      <strong>KGF </strong>is an Indian Kannada-language period action film
      series set mostly in the Kolar Gold Fields, which gives the series its
      name, created by Prashanth Neel and produced by Hombale Films starring
      Yash in lead role with an ensemble supporting cast.[6] Set in the late
      1970s and early <em>1980s</em>, the series follows two narrators, Anand
      Ingalangi and his son Vijayendra Ingalangi, who give an interview of a
      book written by Anand to a leading news channel, which tells the life
      story of Raja Krishnappa Bairya alias Rocky (Yash), a Mumbai-based high
      ranking mercenary born in poverty, and how he became the most dreaded
      person at that time.
